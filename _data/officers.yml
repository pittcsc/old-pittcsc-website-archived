  bio: "I'm a senior CS major who is interested in front-end web development. When I'm not programming I like playing video games (WoW especially), looking at cat pictures, and going to the gym. I'm a dedicated yinzer, so sorry about my Pittsburghese. I'm on slack, twitter, facebook, and check my email obsessively, so if you ever need anything contact me anytime!"
